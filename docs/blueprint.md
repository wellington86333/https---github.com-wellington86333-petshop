# **App Name**: Amazon Deals Finder

## Core Features:

- Deal Display: Display curated deals from Amazon using data provided in src/main.tsx. Each deal should have a title, description, image, and link to the product page on Amazon.
- Deal Filtering: Implement a filtering system to categorize deals based on keywords or product types. Filtering can be done using the information available locally from src/main.tsx without a database.
- AI-Powered Deal Suggestions: Incorporate an AI tool to suggest relevant deals to users based on their browsing behavior and preferences. This feature can use the deal descriptions to find the closest matching deals from src/main.tsx based on user-provided prompts or inferred interests.
- Deal Watchlist: Enable users to save and track deals of interest. This 'watchlist' will use local storage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Amazon orange (#FF9900) to align with the Amazon brand.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a neutral backdrop that enhances readability.
- Accent color: Blue (#007BFF) for interactive elements like buttons and links, providing clear calls to action.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to maintain a modern, machined, objective, and neutral look; suitable for headlines and body text.
- Use clear and recognizable icons for categories and filter options. The style of icons should be modern and match the overall aesthetic.
- Design a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Incorporate subtle animations or transitions to provide feedback on user interactions (e.g., adding an item to the watchlist).
